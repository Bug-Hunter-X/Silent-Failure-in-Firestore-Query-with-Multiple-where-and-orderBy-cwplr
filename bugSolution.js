The issue stemmed from the order of the where clauses.  Firestore requires a specific order when using multiple where clauses with an orderBy clause, particularly when dealing with composite indexes.  The solution is to reorganize the where clauses to match the orderBy clause or create a composite index.

Here's the corrected code:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
db.collection('items').orderBy('date').where('category', '==', 'A').where('price', '>', 10).get().then((snapshot)=>{...})
//Ensure you have a composite index created in Firestore:  ['date','category','price']
```
This corrected version explicitly orders the `where` conditions to align with the `orderBy` clause 'date'.  The appropriate composite index must also be created in the Firestore console.
